#Code - X 
An action packed two-player VR game. Survive with your companion, maintain your humanity and escape becoming a feast among the dead.

##Prologue 


By 2050, artificial intelligence far exceeds mankind's. With great intent, the creators of Eris, the worlds most advanced AI system was programmed to resolve what humanity continues to struggle with, famine, war, disease and inequality.

In an unexpected succession of events, Eris’ answer is to sift through humanity and do away those who hold her from utopia.

Set in an underground complex, home to her experimental test subjects. Eris executes her 4-stage project:

#####1.Physical agility (Initial Room, Zombie Room)

Familiarise with environment and resolve immediate issues at hand. Find methods of defense and defend each other from oncoming zombie stacks.

#####3.Cooperation (Laser and Gas Room)

Deliberate intentions to separate players lead them into pre assigned environments: laser and gas rooms. Players must watch one another suffer as they negotiate through their respective challenge. The player must successfully avoid all strategically placed and motional lasers in order to allow player two to commence. The final section requires both players to cooperate and find missing codes for the other to enter within the time limit before poisoned by gas.

#####4.Emotion (Final Escape)

The final stage tests the players mind. To judge their willingness to sacrifice for one another as Eris announce only one can survive. The complexions come when more failed test subjects are released (zombies) and the decision of life and death is to be made instinctively. The conclusion of this epic game sees a final twist in the storyline. Who will be the one to survive?

##Control:
Code-X requires Samsung Gear VR and game pad controller. 

##Mechanics:

The game tests their ability to follow tasks, find clues (in true Sherlock style) and cooperate together in a whole new level to escape through the next level. There are twists and turns within the storyline in an attempt to take the players off course and loose hope. Both will require their mental agility whilst able to fight off what’s around the corner. Failure for both players to survive will result in the termination of the game. All in all designed to make this game more of a thrilling and unique experience. 

##Innovation:

The game design is centred upon real world Escape Room games, based upon attractive or popular themes. To escape will require players to solve puzzles in true Sherlock style. 

The significant weaknesses far outweigh the benefits in real world scenarios. Cost is the biggest factor to failure. Second, few locations to play. Third, the types of puzzles are limited and at times boring. All the weaknesses can be resolved and enhanced in Gear VR. To experience the impossible in the real world and to achieve a far superior and immersive feel. 

“Code-X” is the first theme of a series, designed for our VR escape room game.



##Getting started:

<img src="https://github.com/mincongzhang/CodeX_public/raw/master/server_UI.jpg" alt="Server_UI" title="Server_UI" height="400"/>

This is a two-player game. Both players must download our “apk” and install on Galaxy Note 4.

Upon starting, follow the UI first before placing in VR headset:
 
Player 1 should choose “Start Server”. Player 2 should choose “join escape”. Following the pairing process, both players will join the game and be able to see one another at base. 

Then, you can place your Galaxy Note 4 in Gear VR. Use your game pad controller to experience the game.

The functions of the game pad controller are illustrated below:

##Techniques:

•	Photon Unity 3D Networking Frameworks SDKs to implement our multiplayer function.  

• Serialized views in Photon are implemented in order to sync multiplayers' action and scene objects.

•	Design Enemy AI system to make the enemies work more intelligently.  

•	Implement holographic effects to make the scene meet our game theme (Sci-Fi).  

•	Use ray cast mechanism in unity to make a interactive ways of manoeuvring within the game.
