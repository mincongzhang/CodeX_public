#Code - X 
An action packed two-player VR game. Survive with your companion, maintain your humanity and escape becoming a feast among the dead.

##Prologue 

By 2050, artificial intelligence far exceeds mankind's. With great intent, the creators of Eris, the worlds most advanced AI system was programmed to resolve what humanity continues to struggle with, famine, war, disease and inequality.

In an unexpected succession of events, Eris’ answer is to sift through humanity and do away those who hold her from utopia.

Set in an underground complex, home to her experimental test subjects. Eris executes her 4-stage project:

1.	Physical agility
2.	Mind game
3.	Cooperation
4.	Emotion

##Control:
Code-X requires Samsung Gear VR and touch pad controller. 

##Mechanics:

The game tests their ability to follow tasks, find clues (in true Sherlock style) and cooperate together in a whole new level to escape through the next level. There are twists and turns within the storyline in an attempt to take the players off course and loose hope. Both will require their mental agility whilst able to fight off what’s around the corner. Failure for both players to survive will result in the termination of the game. All in all designed to make this game more of a thrilling and unique experience. 

##Innovation:

The game design is centred upon real world Escape Room games, based upon attractive or popular themes. To escape will require players to solve puzzles in true Sherlock style. 

The significant weaknesses far outweigh the benefits in real world scenarios. Cost is the biggest factor to failure. Second, few locations to play. Third, the types of puzzles are limited and at times boring. All the weaknesses can be resolved and enhanced in Gear VR. To experience the impossible in the real world and to achieve a far superior and immersive feel. 

“Code-X” is the first theme of a series, designed for our VR escape room game.
